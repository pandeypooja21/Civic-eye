- **Database Storage**: MongoDB for persistent storage of all reported issues
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices from smartphones to desktops

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and building
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Mapbox GL for interactive maps
- WebSockets for real-time updates

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for database
- Fluvio for real-time streaming
- WebSockets for real-time communication

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+) and npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Mapbox API key (for maps)
- Fluvio account (optional, for real-time streaming)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd civic-eye-reporting
```

2. Install frontend dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies
```sh
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Configure environment variables
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Mapbox API key:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:5000
   VITE_MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_api_key_here
   ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with your MongoDB and Fluvio credentials:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/civic-eye
   FLUVIO_ENABLED=false
   FLUVIO_TOPIC=civic-eye-issues
   ```

5. Start the development servers
```sh
npm run start-dev
```

This will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.
